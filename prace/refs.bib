  abstract = {Impact is a complicated phenomenon that occurs when two or more
              bodies collide at a short time period. Impact model is used to
              determine the responses of the contact bodies due to the impact
              event. Furthermore, energy loss due to impact can be determined by
              coefficient of restitution (COR). Although numerous impact models
              have been reported in the literatures, the works to improve the
              model are continuously explored to achieve perfection of the impact
              model. The aims of this paper are to present the methodologies that
              have been used to obtain the impact models and COR, evaluate on the
              pros and cons of the previous impact models and determine the
              potential area to improve the current impact models and COR. The
              methods to obtain COR from experiment and finite element method
              (FEM) are briefly discussed. Besides that, several significant
              impact models developed by the researchers are also compared. It is
              found that more works to determine COR in oblique and repeated
              impacts should be performed. Until now, the viscoplastic impact
              model is considered to be the most reliable in impact application.
              This review is intended to assist the derivation of impact models
              in the future that can improve the accuracy and solve the problem
              in the previous impact models to be applied in various impact
              applications.},

              equations are suggested to satisfy mechanical principles. The
              resistance moment is also calculated to find rolling resistance of
              a golf ball on the green. Then, the rolling friction coefficient is
              deduced using previous results. Finally, the criteria for the
              various run conditions such as the backward bounce and the forward
              bounces before backward roll are discussed in detail based on the
              analysis.},
