How to Calculate Force of Impact ZE ZDROJE TYPU:webpage
   To find the force of impact, you need to know kinetic energy (mass x 1/2 x velocity squared) and distance over which the impact took place.

5.8: Rolling and Slipping Motion ZE ZDROJE TYPU:webpage
   You can easily check that when rotating, the object loses much less kinetic energy to work than when sliding - take a water bottle, either on its bottom (sliding only) or on its side (a little â€¦

Why People At The Edge Of A Merry Go Round Fly Off At Greater Speeds Than The Ones Inside? ZE ZDROJE TYPU:webpage
   Tangential velocity is the component of motion along the edge of a circle measured at any arbitrary instant. Tangential velocity describes the motion of an object along the edge of this circle whose direction at any given point on the circle is always along the tangent to that point.
